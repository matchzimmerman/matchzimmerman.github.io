<h2>Signal vs. Noise</h2>
<p><em>Clarity versus distraction in output</em></p>
<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>The distinction between meaningful, repeatable patterns (signal) and distracting or incoherent outputs (noise).</p>
<h3>What it looks like</h3>
<p>Filtering verbose or off-course responses until the underlying architecture of an idea emerges.</p>
<h3>Overlaps</h3>
<p>Connects Telemetry metrics to Recursive Interaction; informs Iterative Convergence.</p>
<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>Frames the purpose of recursion â€” surfacing clarity and reliability from stochastic output.</p>
