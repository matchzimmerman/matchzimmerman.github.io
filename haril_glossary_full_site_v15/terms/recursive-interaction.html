<h2>Recursive Interaction</h2>
<p><em>Looped engagement for alignment</em></p>
<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>A structured mode of engagement where human and AI loop repeatedly through inquiry and response, refining output with each cycle until alignment emerges. Unlike repetition, recursion compresses noise and surfaces signal.</p>
<h3>What it looks like</h3>
<p>Returning to a prompt multiple times, each round sharpening clarity, structure, and intent.</p>
<h3>Overlaps</h3>
<p>Relates to Recursive Prompt Architecture (RPA) and Compression Threshold; supports Iterative Convergence.</p>
<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>Establishes recursion as the foundation of human–AI alignment — the engine behind refinement and convergence.</p>
